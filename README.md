What do you call a fish with no eyes?

# fsh

A `fish` theme based on the following:

- [queer/p](https://github.com/queer/p)
- [oh-my-zsh's half-life theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/half-life.zsh-theme)
- [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com)

Requires a font with the required icons, I use [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
